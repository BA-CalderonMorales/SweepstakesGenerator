# repo_SweepstakesGenerator
In this project, I learned about user interfaces and how to manipulate them to only print out results instead of using the classes themselves to handle printing. I'm also attempting to adhere to dependency injection and observer pattern principles. This program should be able to assist marketing firms with creating a sweepstakes to their liking, while also being able to add, remove, or several components of a sweepstake, such as the sweepstakes name, number of contestants, the marketing firm name, etc.
